2019-03-04 - Initial release
============================
This is the first public release of these scripts. They have been tested
sufficiently for me to use them in production servers and software myself but I
cannot guarantee they will function perfectly at all times.

This is a reimplementation of my older file system module (mFileSystem). It is
more object-oriented and the source file structure has been  changed to the
format I currently like. It adds support for (nested) zip files, but it does
not support time-outs the way mFileSystem does.
